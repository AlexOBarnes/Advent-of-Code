# Advent of Code

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) - the festive programming puzzle series.

## Structure

- Each day has its own Python script (e.g., `day1.py`).
- Input files are stored in the `input/day{n}` directory.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Either navigate to the folder of the year of the problem or include it in the run command.
3. Ensure the day's data is present in the input folder, following the naming convention.
4. Run the script for the desired day:

   ```sh
   python day1.py
   ```

## Note 
Dependencies will be added as they are used and will be available to sync using uv.

## Additions

I plan to add a client for reading each day's data in automatically, to streamline the process of fetching and preparing puzzle inputs.

## Licence

This repository is for personal use and learning. I'm always keen to hear how I can improve my code so feel free to clone, submit merge requests or message me with suggestions
