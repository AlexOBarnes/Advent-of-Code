# Advent of Code

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2025 - the festive programming puzzle series.

## Structure

- Each day has its own Python script (e.g., `day1.py`).
- Input files are stored in the `input/day{n}` directory.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Place the relevant input file (e.g., `day1.txt`) in the `input/` directory.
3. Run the script for the desired day:

   ```sh
   python day1.py
   ```
## Additions

I plan to add a client for reading each day's data in automatically, to streamline the process of fetching and preparing puzzle inputs.
